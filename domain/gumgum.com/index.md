## Additional info

Our opt-out page reads as follows: 
At GumGum, we believe in making advertising as relevant and engaging as possible to enhance your experience across our premium platform. In order to do this, we use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about the pages you visit on the partner websites in which GumGum is enabled.

We also respect your privacy. If you prefer we do not use this type of log data for serving ads that are more relevant to your interests, please click the “opt-out” button below. Selecting this option lets us know not to use information about your web browsing behavior for ad targeting (also known as ‘behavioral advertising’).

By choosing to “opt-out”, you are opting out of the behavioral targeting. This means you will still receive GumGum ads, they will just not be specifically targeted to you/your interests.
