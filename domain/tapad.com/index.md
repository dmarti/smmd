## How to opt out

Consumers can opt out in a number of ways on Tapad's website. We also provide opt-out opportunities to consumers through our memberships with the NAI and DAA, both of which provide centralized opt-out mechanisms. We require all Partners and Clients to direct consumers to either the Tapad Privacy Notice or one of the industry opt-out mechanisms to ensure notice and access to object to data processing or sale of information by Tapad. Tapad presents “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” links on all of its website pages and offers a toll-free number for submission of requests.

Tapad presents consumers with many ways to exercise their choices regarding data collection and processing via our website and Privacy Notice where they may elect to opt out, access or erase their data. The primary way for a consumer to exercise their rights is by emailing privacy@tapad.com. Tapad corresponds directly with the requestor to fulfill their requests and requires their cookie IDs / MAIDs in order to run queries in our databases.

Access, deletion and opt-outs are all available to consumers via this method.
