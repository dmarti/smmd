24 May 2021: refused a CCPA RtK

A note to United States residents: Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Sift is a "service provider". This means we only process end user data on behalf of our customers (CCPA "businesses") for permitted business purposes. As a service provider under the CCPA, we must direct requests for data to the Sift customer that controls the data which we process on their behalf. Previously, where our customers allowed, Sift honored data access requests no matter the location of the consumer. However, due to the changes in California law, we no longer honor these requests for California end users unless our customers (the “business” under CCPA) explicitly instruct us to do so. Unless otherwise legally required, we are applying the requirements of the CCPA to non-EEA/UK residents as it is currently the primary US data protection law and there are no other applicable regulatory requirements. We hope that a federal data protection law will be implemented in the near term to promote a national standard with better transparency to consumers
